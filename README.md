dotjs
=====

This is a Firefox Add-on port of defunkt's Chrome extension <https://github.com/defunkt/dotjs>.

dotjs is a Firefox Add-on that executes JavaScript files in `~/.js` based on their filename and the domain of the site you are visiting.

If you navigate to `http://www.google.com/`, dotjs will execute `~/.js/google.com.js`.
If you have a `~/.js/default.js`, it will execute on every page you visit.

This makes it super easy to spruce up your favorite pages using JavaScript.

Bonus:  files in `~/.js` have jQuery 1.6.1 loaded, regardless  of  whether  the  site  you're  hacking uses jQuery.

GreaseMonkey user scripts are great, but you need to publish them somewhere and re-publish after making modifications. With dotjs, just add or edit files in `~/.js`.

## Example

    $ cat ~/.js/github.com.js
    // swap github logo with trollface
    $('#header .logo img')
      .css('width', '100px')
      .css('margin-top', '-15px')
      .attr('src', '//bit.ly/ghD24e')
